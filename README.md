# Next quantity prediction

Next quantity prediction is a project that aimed at predicting the quantity each seller is going to sell in the marketplace. I have utilised factors such as Recency Frequency Monetary to check which sellers were causing the maximum sales. Aiming only the highest frequency seller.

This project was an end to end project that involved steps like data loading, data cleaning, data profiling, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), data preprocessing, model selection etc.

Project was implemented by utilizing various Machine Learning Techniques such as different types of Regressors but later on we tried implementing this using LSTM Time- series analysis as well.
